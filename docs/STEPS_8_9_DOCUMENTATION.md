## Implementation Details

### **New Methods Added:**

1. **`create_binary_documentation_prompt()`**
   - Generates comprehensive strategy prompt for binary documentation
   - Returns structured markdown prompt with phases and success criteria
   - Includes objective, phases, deliverables, and success metrics

2. **`execute_binary_documentation()`**
   - Executes the 4-phase binary documentation workflow
   - Tests 15+ MCP endpoints across different categories
   - Tracks success rates and generates findings
   - Returns comprehensive results dictionary with quality metrics

3. **`evaluate_documentation_quality()`**
   - Analyzes documentation results for quality assessment
   - Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas
   - Generates enhanced prompt based on evaluation
   - Saves improved prompt to docs/ directory
   - Returns detailed evaluation with next steps

### **Enhanced run_full_cycle() Method:**
- Added `document_binary` parameter to enable Steps 8 & 9
- Integrated binary documentation execution after Step 7
- Added documentation quality evaluation as Step 9
- Enhanced success reporting with documentation metrics
- Automatic report generation and saving

### **Command Line Integration:**
- Added `--document-binary` flag to enable Steps 8 & 9
- Updated help documentation and usage examples
- Integrated with existing workflow options

## Usage Examples

### **Full Cycle with Binary Documentation**
```bash
# Complete development cycle with binary documentation
python ghidra_dev_cycle.py --comprehensive-test --document-binary --binary-path path/to/binary.exe

# With specific project
python ghidra_dev_cycle.py --document-binary --project-path project.gpr --binary-path binary.exe
```

### **Documentation-Only Workflow** (Future Enhancement)
```bash
# Could be added as a separate mode
python ghidra_dev_cycle.py --document-only --binary-path binary.exe
```

## Real-World Documentation Strategy

### **Phase-Based Approach:**
1. **Metadata Collection**: Architecture, entry points, memory layout
2. **Function Analysis**: Decompilation, call graphs, relationship mapping
