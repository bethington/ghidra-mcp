## Current Releases

### v5.6.0 (Latest) — release regression + fun-doc workflow

Deploy / regression / debugger:

- **Live deploy regression tiers** — `tools.setup deploy` can run selected contract, benchmark read/write, multi-program, negative-contract, debugger-live, and release-grade suites.
- **Benchmark debugger fixture** — `fun-doc/benchmark` now builds `BenchmarkDebug.exe` alongside `Benchmark.dll` so debugger endpoints can be exercised against a real launched process.
- **Scoped prompt policy** — `/prompt_policy` temporarily handles known automation dialogs during deploy/regression runs while leaving normal interactive prompts untouched.
- **Safer deploy lifecycle** — deploy saves open programs/traces, exits or force-kills matching Ghidra processes, starts Ghidra, waits for MCP/project readiness, and runs schema smoke checks.

fun-doc workflow:

- **Worker config snapshot** — workers freeze policy fields (`good_enough_score`, audit/handoff providers, per-provider `provider_max_turns` + `provider_models`) at start; mid-run live edits no longer affect a running worker. Dashboard renders a per-worker config sub-line and toasts when saved config diverges from a running worker's snapshot.
- **Background inventory scorer** — opt-in idle-time daemon that fills missing `analyze_function_completeness` scores across every binary in the Ghidra project tree. Most-missing-first ordering, single-thread, cooperative pause when doc workers run, session blacklist after 3 strikes. Inventory panel shows per-binary coverage.
- **Quota-aware provider pause/resume** — fun-doc parses provider quota-wall errors (gemini "exhausted your capacity", claude "credit balance is too low", codex "insufficient_quota", minimax) and parks every worker on the affected (provider, model) until the parsed reset time. Soft rate limits (<5 min) stay in retry logic; hard walls (≥5 min) install a pause. Dashboard shows a `quota_paused` worker state with a live wake-time countdown.
- **Function-block worker output** — per-function logs are wrapped in a three-sided gold bracket (top + left + bottom), with header + footer showing the function name (post-rescore name in the footer so renames are visible). Three-column worker grid for higher density.
- **Three new endpoints** — `GET/POST /api/inventory/...` and `GET/POST /api/provider_pauses/...`.

Function-name quality enforcement:

- **Verb-tier rules** at the rename layer: `rename_function_by_address` hard-rejects names that fail Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 specificity checks or collide via token-subset with another function in the same program. Returns a structured error (`vague_verb`, `weak_noun_only`, `missing_specifier`, `name_collision`) with a concrete suggestion. Three new completeness deductions surface existing bad names in the work queue.

- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.5.0 — maintenance release

- **Decompiler lifecycle fixes** — `FunctionService` now disposes owned `DecompInterface` instances across success, early-return, and exception paths instead of leaking subprocesses in long-running sessions.
- **Bridge compatibility fix** — Python tool-name sanitization now enforces Claude/CAPI's 64-character limit and valid-character rules during collision handling.
- **Bundled script hardening** — script-side `DecompInterface` ownership was normalized to scoped cleanup, and Claude-invoking scripts now use bounded waits with terminate/kill fallback.
- **Contributor guidance** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` includes a release-relevant resource-ownership checklist for disposables, transactions, child-process handling, and timeout expectations.
- **Release metadata refresh** — Maven/package metadata, headless/plugin fallback versions, endpoint catalog version, and release docs were updated to `5.5.0`.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.4.1 — security release

- **Bearer-token auth** — when `GHIDRA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, every HTTP request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Timing-safe comparison. `/mcp/health`, `/health`, `/check_connection` are auth-exempt.
- **Bind hardening** — headless server refuses to start on non-loopback `--bind` unless a token is configured.
- **Script gate (breaking change)** — `/run_script_inline` and `/run_ghidra_script` default to 403 unless `GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1` is set. These endpoints execute arbitrary Java against the Ghidra process; the pre-v5.4.1 default was unauthenticated RCE when exposed beyond loopback.
- **`GHIDRA_MCP_FILE_ROOT` mechanism** — path-root canonicalization helper for file-handling endpoints. Per-endpoint wire-up scheduled for a follow-on release.
- **CI / ops** — Debugger JARs installed across all 4 GitHub Actions workflows; offline Java tests (11, ~3s) now gate every push/PR; deprecated Ghidra API warnings suppressed; `requests` floor raised to 2.32.0 per CVE-2024-35195.
- **Docs refresh** — `README.md` Security section, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (v5.4.0 entry backfilled), operator prompt docs now cover emulation / debugger / data-flow.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.4.0 — feature release

- **P-code emulation** — `EmulationService` adds `/emulate_function` and `/emulate_hash_batch` (brute-force API hash resolution, collision-safe).
- **Live debugger integration** — new `DebuggerService` (17 `/debugger/*` Java endpoints) wrapping Ghidra's TraceRmi framework. Standalone Python `debugger/` package on port 8099 with 22 bridge proxy tools. GUI-only.
- **Data flow analysis** — `/analyze_dataflow` traces PCode-graph value propagation (forward = consumers, backward = producers).
- **Headless program/project management** — `HeadlessManagementService` moves 8 previously-hand-registered headless endpoints into the annotation scanner.
- **Tool count 199 → 222** after catalog regeneration.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.3.2 — hotfix

- Pass 2 (`FULL:comments`) now runs for codex and claude — gate fixed so the `-1` sentinel no longer silently skips comments pass.
- `stagnation_runs` one-shot blacklist — stops infinite re-pick loops (200+ stuck-loop runs eliminated in first session).
- Claude `BLOCKED:` false-positive fix — system prompt directs claude to call `mcp__ghidra-mcp__<tool>` directly instead of using `ToolSearch`.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.3.1 — hotfix

- `NO_RETRY_DECOMPILE_TIMEOUT = 12s` on all MCP scoring handler paths — eliminates EDT saturation deadlocks.
- 4 additional MCP handler call sites routed through `decompileFunctionNoRetry`.
- Live-verified: 63 runs × 3 providers × 6 parallel workers with zero failures over 125 min.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.3.0 — stability + observability

- `/mcp/health` endpoint: pool stats, uptime, memory, active request count.
- HTTP thread pool (size 3): fixes EDT saturation deadlocks.
- Offline annotation-scanner test suite — catches `@McpTool` / `endpoints.json` drift without Ghidra.
- Atomic `state.json` writes via temp + fsync + os.replace + .bak rotation.
- 199 MCP tools.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v5.2.0 — scoring redesign + naming enforcement

- Log-scaled budget scoring system with tiered plate comment quality.
- `NamingConventions.java`: auto-fix Hungarian prefixes, PascalCase validation, module prefix support.
- New tools: `set_variables`, `check_tools`, `rename_variables`.
- 193 MCP tools.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v4.3.0 — knowledge DB + BSim

- 5 new knowledge DB MCP tools (store/query function knowledge, ordinal mappings, export).
- BSim Ghidra scripts for cross-version function similarity matching.
- Fixed enum value parsing (GitHub issue #44).
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v4.1.0 — parallel multi-binary

- Every program-scoped MCP tool now accepts optional `program` parameter.
- 188 MCP tools.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

### v4.0.0 — service layer refactor

- Extracted 12 shared service classes (`com.xebyte.core/`). Plugin reduced 69%, headless reduced 67%. Zero breaking changes.
- 184 MCP tools.
- See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for full details.
