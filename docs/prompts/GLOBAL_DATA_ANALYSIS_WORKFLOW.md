Systematically analyze both .data (mutable globals) and .rdata (read-only constants) sections by segmenting data between external references (xrefs), treating each contiguous region as a logical unit, then for each segment record the address range and size, inspect memory content to identify data types (pointers, strings, primitives, arrays, sentinel markers), analyze all xrefs to understand usage patterns and purpose (lookup tables, configuration structures, constant values, string literals), determine if the segment is a single structure or array based on how code accesses it, rename each segment using Hungarian notation with g_ prefix for mutable globals in .data and k_ prefix for read-only constants in .rdata with appropriate type prefixes (dw=dword, w=word, b=byte, p=pointer, psz=string pointer, a=array) and descriptive names based on actual usage (e.g., g_dwPlayerHealthMax, k_dwMaxInventorySlots, g_aMonsterStats, k_pszWelcomeMessage), prioritize segments by reference count, create appropriate structure definitions for complex data, and use MCP tools including list_data_items(), get_xrefs_to(), inspect_memory_content(), get_assembly_context(), create_struct(), apply_data_type(), and rename_or_label() to automate the workflow.
