# Enhanced Binary Documentation Strategy using Ghidra MCP Tools
# (Generated based on quality evaluation - Score: 75.0%)

## Objective
Execute comprehensive binary documentation with improved error handling and validation.

## Pre-Phase: Validation & Preparation
0. **MCP Connectivity Verification**
   - Verify all required MCP endpoints are accessible
   - Test basic functionality before starting documentation
   - Establish fallback strategies for failed endpoints

## Phase 1: Enhanced Initial Analysis
1. **Robust Program Metadata Collection**
   - Primary: Get program metadata with validation
   - Fallback: Manual analysis if automatic collection fails
   - Validation: Verify critical metadata fields are populated

2. **Comprehensive Entry Point Discovery**
   - Primary: Use get_entry_points endpoint
   - Secondary: Search for common entry point patterns (main, WinMain, DllMain)
   - Validation: Ensure at least one valid entry point is identified

## Phase 2: Intelligent Function Analysis
3. **Adaptive Function Discovery**
   - List all functions with pagination handling
   - Identify critical functions based on import/export analysis
   - Prioritize analysis based on function complexity and references

4. **Smart Decompilation Strategy**
   - Attempt decompilation of main/primary functions
   - If main fails, identify and analyze alternative entry points
   - Include error handling for decompilation failures

## Phase 3: Enhanced Data Analysis
5. **Comprehensive String Analysis**
   - Extract strings with categorization
   - Identify security-relevant strings (URLs, file paths, credentials)
   - Analyze string usage patterns and references

6. **Advanced Data Structure Creation**
   - Create structures based on actual data patterns found
   - Include validation of structure creation success
   - Generate meaningful structure names and documentation

## Phase 4: Security-Focused Analysis
7. **Vulnerability Assessment Integration**
   - Identify potentially dangerous function calls
   - Analyze input validation patterns
   - Document security implications of findings

8. **Performance and Quality Metrics**
   - Track analysis completion rates
   - Measure endpoint response times
   - Generate quality scores for each phase

## Phase 5: Intelligent Reporting
9. **Adaptive Report Generation**
   - Generate reports based on successful analysis phases
   - Include fallback content for failed analyses
   - Provide actionable next steps based on results

## Enhanced Success Criteria
- Minimum 85% phase completion rate
- All critical endpoints functional
- Comprehensive error handling demonstrated
- Security implications identified and documented
- Professional documentation with quality metrics

## Quality Assurance
- Continuous validation of MCP endpoint responses
- Error rate monitoring and improvement suggestions
- Automated quality scoring and improvement recommendations
