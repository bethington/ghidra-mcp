## The 5 Essential Prompts

### Prompt 1: STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

**Use this when**: You have a struct name and want to understand it fully

```
I need to identify and document a data structure for binary analysis.

GIVEN:
- Struct name: [NAME]
- Binary: [D2Common.dll]
- Source file: [D2Structs.h]

REQUIRED OUTPUT:

1. STRUCT DEFINITION
   Complete struct with all fields and offsets

2. FIELD MAPPING
   Every offset → field name → type → purpose

3. UNIQUE FINGERPRINT
   The most reliable way to identify this struct in decompilation
   - Key identifying fields
   - Distinguishing field combinations
   - Signature patterns

4. RELATED STRUCTURES
   Any dependent or related structs

5. EXPECTED USAGE
   List of likely functions using this struct

PROCESS:
- Search source code for struct definition
- Extract exact field layout with offsets
- Identify fields that appear in decompilation patterns
- Document what makes this struct unique
- Predict which functions would use it based on name/purpose
```

### Prompt 2: FUNCTION DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS

**Use this when**: You need to find all functions using a struct

```
I need to systematically find all functions using a specific struct.

GIVEN:
- Target struct: [STRUCT_NAME]
- Field offsets: [DOCUMENT THEM]
- Struct size: [HEX_SIZE]
- Key fields: [LIST THEM]

SEARCH STRATEGY:

1. MULTI-AXIS SEARCH

   Search Axis 1: Field Offset Patterns
   - Find functions accessing offset 0x[OFFSET1]
   - Find functions accessing offset 0x[OFFSET2]
   - Find functions accessing offset 0x[OFFSET3]
   - Intersect results = likely struct users

   Search Axis 2: Function Name Patterns
   - Functions containing struct-related keywords
   - Functions with Get*, Set*, Create*, Process* prefixes
   - Related data type names

   Search Axis 3: Cross-References
   - Functions that call known struct users
   - Functions called by known struct users

   Search Axis 4: Size Patterns
   - Functions that allocate struct_size bytes
   - Functions that memcpy struct_size bytes
   - Functions that memset struct_size bytes

2. COLLECT CANDIDATES
   For each function found:
   - Address and name
   - Which search triggered it
   - Confidence level

3. DECOMPILE ANALYSIS
   For each candidate:
   - Get decompilation
   - Check for struct access patterns
   - Document which fields are accessed
   - Note how they're accessed (offset vs pointer)

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
- 30+ candidate functions
- Access pattern for each
- Confidence scoring
```

### Prompt 3: CONFIDENCE SCORING & VALIDATION

**Use this when**: You need to verify if a function really uses a struct

```
I need to score and validate suspected struct usage.

FOR EACH FUNCTION:

1. PATTERN MATCHING SCORE

   Count matches:
   - Accessing field offset 0x[OFF1]? +15%
   - Accessing field offset 0x[OFF2]? +15%
   - Accessing field offset 0x[OFF3]? +15%
   - Consistent offset pattern? +10%
   - Only accesses valid offsets? +10%

   Total: Baseline pattern score

2. CONTEXT SCORE

   Evaluate context:
   - Function name related to struct? +20%
   - Parameter type matches expectation? +10%
   - Return type matches expectation? +10%
   - Called by related functions? +10%
   - Calls functions that use this struct? +10%

   Total: Context bonus

3. LOGIC SCORE

   Does usage make sense?
   - Accesses are logical (not random)? +20%
   - No contradictory accesses? +10%
   - Pattern is consistent throughout function? +10%

   Total: Logic bonus

4. FALSE POSITIVE CHECKS

   ☐ Not just one coincidental field access
   ☐ Not generic memory manipulation
   ☐ Not different struct with same offsets
   ☐ Not hard-coded values that happen to match
   ☐ Access pattern is struct-specific

CONFIDENCE = FINAL_SCORE / 100

Interpretation:
  >85%  = CONFIRMED - Apply struct immediately
  70-85% = LIKELY - Apply after review
  50-70% = POSSIBLE - Investigate further
  <50%  = UNLIKELY - Skip for now
```

### Prompt 4: STRUCT CREATION & APPLICATION

**Use this when**: Ready to create struct in Ghidra and apply to functions

```
I need to create a struct in Ghidra and apply it to functions.

GIVEN:
- Struct name: [NAME]
- Complete field list with offsets/types
- List of functions to apply it to
- Confidence scores for each function

CREATION PHASE:
1. Create struct with all fields
2. Verify struct created successfully
3. Check struct appears in type list

APPLICATION PHASE:
1. Sort functions by confidence (HIGH first)
2. Apply to confidence > 85% functions
3. Review 60-85% functions manually
4. Skip < 60% confidence functions

VERIFICATION PHASE:
1. Spot-check 10 random applications
2. Open in decompiler, verify output
3. Check for type errors
4. Verify field accesses are now named

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Struct available in Ghidra
- Functions with proper parameter types
- Decompiler output uses struct field names
- No type errors reported
```

### Prompt 5: RESULTS DOCUMENTATION

**Use this when**: Need to document complete findings

```
I need to create comprehensive documentation of discovered structures.

DOCUMENTATION MUST INCLUDE:

1. STRUCT REFERENCE
   - Complete definition
   - All fields with offsets
   - Total size
   - Source location

2. FUNCTIONS LIST
   - All functions using struct
   - Confidence score each
   - Brief description of each
   - Status (applied/pending/skipped)

3. EXAMPLES
   - Before/after decompilation
   - Show improvement in readability
   - Highlight key field accesses

4. STATISTICS
   - Total functions analyzed
   - Confidence distribution
   - Coverage percentage
   - Related structures

5. VERIFICATION REPORT

## Step-by-Step Execution Guide

### Step 1: Identify Structure (2 hours)

```
1.1 Find source definition
    grep -n "struct PlayerData" D2Structs.h

1.2 Extract complete definition
    Manual copy from source file

1.3 Create offset table
    Manually compute/verify offsets

1.4 Document fingerprint
    - Unique field combinations
    - Distinguishing patterns
    - Signature values

1.5 List related structures
    - Parent structures
    - Member structures

OUTPUT:
  File: STRUCT_[NAME]_DEFINITION.md
  Contains: Complete struct docs + fingerprint
```

### Step 2: Discover Functions (3-4 hours)

```
2.1 Execute multi-axis searches

    Search 1: Offset 0x10 (first key field)
      curl "http://ghidra:8089/search_functions_enhanced?query=0x10&offset=true"
      → 500+ results

    Search 2: Offset 0x1c (second key field)
      curl "http://ghidra:8089/search_functions_enhanced?query=0x1c&offset=true"
      → 400+ results

    Search 3: Name contains "Player"
      curl "http://ghidra:8089/search_functions_enhanced?query=Player&name=true"
      → 50 results

    Search 4: Name contains "Quest"
      curl "http://ghidra:8089/search_functions_enhanced?query=Quest&name=true"
      → 30 results

    Intersection: (Search1 AND Search2) OR (Search3 AND Search4)
    → ~50 promising candidates

2.2 Decompile each candidate

    for address in candidates:
      decompile_function(address)
      analyze_access_patterns(decompilation)
      record_findings()

2.3 Collect findings

    OUTPUT:
      File: CANDIDATES_[NAME].csv
      Contains:
        Address, Name, Pattern Match, Confidence, Notes

OUTPUT:
  File: FUNCTION_DISCOVERY_[NAME].md
  Contains: 50+ functions with analysis
```

### Step 3: Validate & Score (2 hours)

```
3.1 For each candidate, calculate confidence

    confidence = (pattern_score * 0.4) +
                (context_score * 0.4) +
                (logic_score * 0.2)

3.2 Eliminate false positives

    for function in candidates:
      if only_one_field_match(): skip
      if random_offset_access(): skip
      if contradictory_patterns(): skip
      else: keep

3.3 Sort by confidence

    high = candidates where confidence > 80
    med  = candidates where 60 < confidence <= 80
    low  = candidates where confidence <= 60

3.4 Select for application

    apply_immediately = high confidence list
    apply_after_review = medium confidence list
    skip_for_now = low confidence list

OUTPUT:
  File: VALIDATION_RESULTS_[NAME].md
  Contains:
    - Scoring methodology
    - All scores calculated
    - Functions grouped by confidence
    - False positives eliminated
    - Recommended application list
```

### Step 4: Create & Apply (2-3 hours)

```
4.1 Create struct in Ghidra

    POST to /create_struct with:
    - name: "PlayerData"
    - size: "0x28"
    - fields: [all field definitions]

    Verify:
      ✓ Struct created
      ✓ Appears in type list
      ✓ Size is correct
      ✓ All fields present

4.2 Apply to high confidence functions

    for function in apply_immediately:
      set_function_prototype(address, new_prototype)
      mark_as_applied()

    Example:
      Address: 0x401234
      Name: GetPlayerQuests
      Old: void *GetPlayerQuests(void *pPlayer)
      New: void *GetPlayerQuests(PlayerData *pPlayer)

4.3 Spot-check 10 random applications

    for i in range(10):
      func = random_from_applied_list()
      decompile(func)
      verify:
        ✓ Parameter typed as PlayerData*
        ✓ Field accesses show struct.field syntax
        ✓ No type errors
        ✓ Output is sensible

OUTPUT:
  File: APPLICATION_RESULTS_[NAME].md
  Contains:

## Common Patterns to Look For

### Pattern 1: Simple Accessor Functions

```c
// Decompilation
void *GetPlayerQuests(void *pPlayer) {
    return *(void**)(pPlayer + 0x10);
}

// Indicators:
// - Single field access
// - Offset matches struct field
// - Simple return
// - High confidence if function name matches
```

### Pattern 2: Initialization Functions

```c
// Decompilation
void CreatePlayerData(void *pPlayer) {
    memset(pPlayer, 0, 0x28);  // Struct size!
    *(void**)(pPlayer + 0x10) = alloc_quest_data();
    *(void**)(pPlayer + 0x1c) = alloc_waypoint();
}

// Indicators:
// - Memset with exact struct size
// - Multiple field initializations
// - Consistent offset pattern
// - Very high confidence
```

### Pattern 3: Copy Operations

```c
// Decompilation
void SavePlayerData(FILE *f, void *pPlayer) {
    fwrite(pPlayer, 1, 0x28, f);  // Struct size!
}

// Indicators:
// - Exact size match
// - Generic file I/O
// - Simple memcpy-like operation
// - Confidence depends on function name
```

### Pattern 4: Linked List Traversal

```c
// Decompilation
for (pCurr = pList; pCurr; pCurr = *(void**)(pCurr + 0xE8)) {
    int id = *(int*)(pCurr + 0x0C);
    // Process unit
}

// Indicators:
// - Self-referential pointer pattern (pListNext)
// - Consistent offset access
// - List traversal logic
// - Very high confidence
```

### Pattern 5: Conditional Type Checking

```c
// Decompilation
if (*(int*)(pUnit + 0x00) == 1) {  // Type field
    // Process as monster
    void *pMon = *(void**)(pUnit + 0x14);
}

// Indicators:
// - Type field check (offset 0x00)
// - Union field access (offset 0x14)
// - Type-specific processing
// - High confidence
```

## Final Thoughts

This methodology transforms:

```
❌ void ProcessUnit(void *pData) {
       int type = *(int*)(pData + 0x00);
       int id = *(int*)(pData + 0x0C);
       int x = *(short*)(pData + 0x8C);
       int y = *(short*)(pData + 0x8E);
   }

✅ void ProcessUnit(UnitAny *pUnit) {
       int type = pUnit->dwType;
       int id = pUnit->dwUnitId;
       int x = pUnit->wX;
       int y = pUnit->wY;
   }
```

The result: **Dramatically more readable** binary code with proper typing and named fields.
